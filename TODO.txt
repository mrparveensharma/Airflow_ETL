Things I expect to learn today:
1. Dag with multiple components. -> done
2. Dag that can be triggered with an API and no schedule.
3. Dag which can be triggered from UI.
4. Airflow configurations. -> xcoms & macros done.
5. Refresh pandas and numpy skills.

Helpful packages:
tempfile

Main Project:
Extract: Pull stock data from kite or kotak securities.
Transform: Calculate technical indicator values and add it in dataframe.
Load: Consider github or maybe some other place where I should load it. Later have a functionality to send events over firebase cloud notification.

Project idea -> create an ETL process that pulls the data 1m,5m stock data every 15 minutes and process it and calculate different indicator values and store it for a list of stocks.
